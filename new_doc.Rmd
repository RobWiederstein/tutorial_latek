## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Xie recommends using BibTex databases because they work better when the output is LaTeX/PDF.[@xie2020r] For example, number theory is important.[@borevich1986number] Numbers like $1, 2, ... n$ are natural numbers.[@hua2012introduction] You can use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) to organize your sources and then export the citations to `sources.bib` as specified in the front or "YAML" matter.  Additionally, the `citr` [package](https://github.com/crsh/citr) can automate insertion of the reference.
